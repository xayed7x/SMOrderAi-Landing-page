I have removed the top padding from the hero section's wrapper in `app/page.tsx`. This was causing the extra margin/padding issue after the navigation bar was made sticky. This change should resolve the layout problem.

**Recent Updates:**

*   **Integrated Demo Section:** Rendered the new `DemoSection` right after the `HeroSection` in `app/page.tsx`.
*   **Dependency Management:** Installed `framer-motion` to resolve module not found errors and corrected `DemoSection` import to a named import.
*   **Image Assets:** Updated image sources within the `DemoSection` to use public assets (1.png through 5.png).
*   **Theming & Consistency:**
    *   Adjusted the `DemoSection` background color to match the `HeroSection`.
    *   Standardized the style of all "Pre-Register Now" buttons across `HeroSection`, `DemoSection`, `EarlyBirdPricing`, `VisionSection`, and the navigation bar, applying a consistent gradient and shimmer animation.
    *   Updated the color of progress dots in `DemoSection` to align with the brand's color palette.
*   **Animation Refinement:** Fixed the shimmer animation implementation by switching to a pseudo-element approach to prevent conflicts with background colors.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Improved the image gallery layout in `DemoSection` to display three images in desktop view, removed distracting scroll text hints, and updated navigation arrow colors.
    *   Applied subtle hover effects (shadow and slight upward translation) to various cards in `ProblemSection`, `SolutionSection`, `EarlyBirdPricing`, `VisionSection`, `HowItWorks`, and `TestimonialsSection`.
    *   Made pricing cards in `EarlyBirdPricing` selectable with a border highlight, making plan selection a required step for the pre-registration form.
*   **Content & SEO:**
    *   Updated the `HeroSection`'s visual element (emojis and text) to better reflect the new, fully automated order system.
    *   Revised the project's metadata (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter tags) to accurately showcase advanced AI order automation capabilities, moving beyond just comment replies.
