The `components/footer-section.tsx` file defines the current footer structure. To make the requested changes, I need you to provide the specific new content for the following sections:

-   **Brand description**: What should replace "AI-powered social commerce for SMEs"?
-   **Social media links/icons**: Any changes to the X, LinkedIn, or WhatsApp links/icons?
-   **Navigation links**:
    -   Under "Product": Features, Pricing, FAQ, Try Free
    -   Under "Company": About us, Contact
    -   Under "Contact": zayed.b.hamid@gmail.com, WhatsApp
    Please specify any additions, removals, or modifications to these links or their text.
-   **Copyright notice**: What should replace "© 2025 Autex. All rights reserved."?

Once you provide this information, I will proceed with updating the footer.
